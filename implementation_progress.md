# FlowOrchestrator Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the FlowOrchestrator system. It will be updated after each component is built and tested, following an incremental build-and-verify approach.

## Build Verification Process

For each component, the following build verification process will be followed:

1. **Component Implementation**: Implement the component according to the architecture specifications
2. **Component Build**: Build the individual component (`dotnet build <project-path>`)
3. **Unit Tests**: Create and run unit tests for the component (`dotnet test <test-project-path>`)
4. **Solution Build**: Build the entire solution to verify integration (`dotnet build`)
5. **Integration Tests**: Run relevant integration tests if applicable
6. **Documentation**: Update this progress document with build results and test outcomes

Only when a component successfully builds and passes its tests will we proceed to the next component.

## Implementation Verification Guidelines

To ensure accurate tracking of implementation progress and avoid mistakes in the incremental build process:

1. **Thorough Verification Before Proceeding**
   - Verify completion status against the actual implementation plan, not just high-level categories
   - Use systematic checks rather than assumptions about completion
   - Confirm all required files exist and contain the expected functionality

2. **Explicit Checklist Approach**
   - Create and follow a detailed checklist of all required components for each phase
   - Mark items as complete only after confirming their implementation
   - Review the entire checklist before moving to the next phase

3. **Consistent Progress Tracking**
   - Maintain a clear record of what has been implemented vs. what remains
   - Update this document after each implementation session
   - Include specific details about implementation status in the Notes column

4. **Implementation Plan Adherence**
   - Strictly follow the implementation plan's sequence
   - Complete each phase fully before moving to the next
   - Document any deviations from the plan with justification

5. **Periodic Verification**
   - Regularly verify the state of the codebase against requirements
   - Use tools like `find` to check for the existence of expected files
   - Review file contents to ensure they match expected functionality

6. **Component Completeness Criteria**
   - A component is only considered complete when:
     - All planned classes and interfaces are implemented
     - All required functionality is present
     - All tests pass
     - The component integrates with the rest of the solution
     - This document is updated with accurate status information
