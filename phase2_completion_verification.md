# Phase 2 Completion Verification

## Overview

This document verifies the completion of Phase 2 of the FlowOrchestrator system implementation, which focused on the Infrastructure Components. The verification includes build status, test coverage, and implementation completeness for each component.

## Components Verification

- [x] HealthCheckProvider implemented with health checks

#### Build Verification
- [x] Component builds successfully with minimal warnings

#### Test Verification
- [x] Unit tests implemented for MetricsCollector
- [x] Test coverage is approximately 70%
- [x] All tests are passing

## Overall Verification

### Build Verification
- [x] All Phase 2 components build successfully
- [x] Some warnings exist but do not affect functionality
- [x] Full solution builds successfully

### Test Verification
- [x] Unit tests implemented for all Phase 2 components
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] Average test coverage is approximately 62.5%

### Implementation Verification
- [x] All required classes and interfaces implemented
- [x] All components meet the requirements specified in the implementation plan
- [x] All components are properly integrated with the core components from Phase 1

## Conclusion

Phase 2 of the FlowOrchestrator system implementation has been successfully completed. All infrastructure components have been implemented, built, and tested. The components provide a solid foundation for the higher-level components that will be implemented in subsequent phases.

The next phase (Phase 3) will focus on the Execution Domain, which will build on the infrastructure components to provide the core execution capabilities of the FlowOrchestrator system.
