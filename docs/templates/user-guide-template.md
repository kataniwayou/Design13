# FlowOrchestrator User Guide

## Introduction

The FlowOrchestrator is a powerful platform for defining, managing, and executing data flows. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using the FlowOrchestrator system, including flow creation, configuration, execution, and monitoring.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Windows, Linux, or macOS operating system
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 1GB free disk space

### Installation

1. Download the FlowOrchestrator package from the official repository
2. Extract the package to your desired installation directory
3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```
   setup.bat
   ```
4. Verify the installation:
   ```
   floworch --version
   ```

## Creating Flows

### Flow Definition Basics

A flow in FlowOrchestrator consists of components connected together to process data. Each flow has:

- A unique identifier
- A name and description
- A version
- A collection of components
- A collection of connections between components

### Creating a Flow Definition

To create a flow definition, you need to:

1. Define the flow metadata (ID, name, description, version)
2. Add components to the flow
3. Configure each component
4. Define connections between components

Example:

```csharp
var flowDefinition = new FlowDefinition
{
    FlowId = "my-first-flow",
    Name = "My First Flow",
    Description = "A simple data transformation flow",
    Version = "1.0.0",
    Components = new List<FlowComponent>
    {
        new FlowComponent
        {
            ComponentId = "source",
            Name = "Source Component",
            ComponentType = "FileImporter",
            Configuration = new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                { "filePath", "data.json" }
            }
        },
        new FlowComponent
        {
            ComponentId = "transform",
            Name = "Transform Component",
            ComponentType = "JsonProcessor",
            Configuration = new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                { "operations", new[] { "uppercase", "trim" } }
            }
        },
        new FlowComponent
        {
            ComponentId = "destination",
            Name = "Destination Component",
            ComponentType = "FileExporter",
            Configuration = new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                { "filePath", "output.json" }
            }
        }
    },
    Connections = new List<FlowConnection>
    {
        new FlowConnection
        {
            ConnectionId = "conn1",
            SourceComponentId = "source",
            TargetComponentId = "transform"
        },
        new FlowConnection
        {
            ConnectionId = "conn2",
            SourceComponentId = "transform",
            TargetComponentId = "destination"
        }
    }
};
```

### Saving a Flow Definition

To save a flow definition:

```csharp
var flowManager = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFlowManager>();
await flowManager.SaveFlowDefinitionAsync(flowDefinition);
```

## Executing Flows

### Flow Execution Basics

Flow execution involves:

1. Loading a flow definition
2. Initializing the components
3. Executing the components in the correct order
4. Handling the results

### Executing a Flow

To execute a flow:

```csharp
var orchestrator = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFlowOrchestrator>();
var result = await orchestrator.ExecuteFlowAsync(flowDefinition.FlowId);
```

### Monitoring Flow Execution

You can monitor flow execution using:

```csharp
var executionId = result.ExecutionId;
var status = await orchestrator.GetExecutionStatusAsync(executionId);
```

## Component Types

### Source Components

Source components are responsible for importing data into the flow:

- FileImporter: Imports data from files
- DatabaseImporter: Imports data from databases
- ApiImporter: Imports data from APIs
- MessageQueueImporter: Imports data from message queues

### Transformation Components

Transformation components process and transform data:

- JsonProcessor: Processes JSON data
- XmlProcessor: Processes XML data
- CsvProcessor: Processes CSV data
- DataMapper: Maps data between different schemas

### Validation Components

Validation components validate data:

- SchemaValidator: Validates data against a schema
- RuleValidator: Validates data against rules
- CustomValidator: Validates data using custom logic

### Destination Components

Destination components export data from the flow:

- FileExporter: Exports data to files
- DatabaseExporter: Exports data to databases
- ApiExporter: Exports data to APIs
- MessageQueueExporter: Exports data to message queues
