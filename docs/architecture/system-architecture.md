# FlowOrchestrator System Architecture

## Overview

The FlowOrchestrator system is designed as a modular, extensible platform for defining, managing, and executing data flows. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, including its core components, their interactions, and the design principles that guide the implementation.

## Architectural Principles

The FlowOrchestrator architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled modules that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
2. **Extensibility**: The architecture allows for easy extension of functionality through well-defined interfaces and extension points.
3. **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing loads.
4. **Resilience**: The architecture includes mechanisms for error handling, recovery, and graceful degradation.
5. **Observability**: The system provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, and diagnostics capabilities.

## Core Components

### Core Domain

The core domain consists of the fundamental abstractions and entities that define the FlowOrchestrator system:

- **Abstractions**: Core interfaces and abstract classes that define the system's contracts
- **Domain**: Domain entities and value objects that represent the business concepts
- **Common**: Utility classes and cross-cutting concerns

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer provides the technical capabilities required by the system:

- **Data**: Data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- **Messaging**: Message-based communication infrastructure
- **Telemetry**: Monitoring, logging, and diagnostics infrastructure

### Management

The management layer provides services for managing the system's entities:

- **FlowManager**: Services for managing flow definitions
- **VersionManager**: Services for managing component versions and compatibility

### Execution

The execution layer is responsible for executing flows:

- **Orchestrator**: Core orchestration service that coordinates flow execution
- **MemoryManager**: Memory allocation and management service
- **BranchController**: Service for managing parallel execution branches
- **Recovery**: Error recovery and compensation mechanisms

### Integration

The integration layer provides connectivity to external systems:

- **Importers**: Components for importing data from external sources
- **Exporters**: Components for exporting data to external destinations
- **ProtocolAdapters**: Adapters for different communication protocols

### Processing

The processing layer provides data transformation and validation capabilities:

- **ProcessorBase**: Base interfaces and classes for processors
- **TransformationEngine**: Engine for data transformation
- **Validation**: Framework for data validation
- **Processors**: Specific processor implementations
